### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abdullah

As an Electronics and Communications Engineering student, I am a student with a great interest in software and programming. With the certificates I have in basic programming languages â€‹â€‹such as C, C++, and Java, I have taken various steps for developments in the software world. I also have advanced knowledge of Java and Spring Boot products. I aim to work in the web field and I actively take part in real projects to gain practical experience in line with this goal.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
